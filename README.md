Question: 7
Software Design Principles:
Answer: 
Software design principles are fundamental guidelines that help in creating high-quality software. These principles ensure that the software is robust, maintainable, scalable, and efficient.

Question: 8
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Answer: 
Modularity in software design refers to dividing a system into separate modules or components. Each module handles a specific functionality and operates independently. 
Modular design is commonly used in various consumer products like cars, smartphones, computers, and televisions. Other modular design examples include software engineering, software product design, and even large websites (with each webpage as an individual component). A famous example of modularity is LEGO.
Modularity in software design helps to improve maintainability of software system through parallel development where teams can work on different modules simultaneously without interfering with each other, increasing productivity and reducing development time.
Modularity also allow for unit testing of individual modules, making it easier to identify and fix defects.
Modularity also supports scalable development and deployment, allowing systems to grow and adapt to changing requirements and increased demand. This approach leads to more robust, flexible, and sustainable software systems.


Question: 11
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Answer:
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it's supposed to do. 
-UNIT TESTING
Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually scrutinized for proper operation. The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended.
An example of a real-world scenario that could be covered by a unit test is a checking that your car door can be unlocked, where you test that the door is unlocked using your car key, but it is not unlocked using your house key, garage door remote, or your neighbour's (who happen to have the same car as your) key.
-INTEGRATION TESTING
Integration testing is a type of software testing where components of the software are gradually integrated and then tested as a unified group. With integration testing, testers want to find defects that surface due to code conflicts between software modules when they are integrated with each other.
For example the fuel system may be tested in collaboration with an exhaust system, and later, these two module's working is tested in collaboration with the working of an engine. 
-SYSTEM TESTING
System testing is a significant stage in the software development life cycle that involves testing the complete system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. 
During this testing, various techniques are used to identify defects, validate the system's functionality, and ensure its overall quality.
For example, if the software is an e-commerce website,testing the process of adding a product to the cart, making a payment, and then receiving a confirmation email. 
-ACCEPTANCE TESTING
Acceptance testing is software testing that evaluates whether a system meets its business and user requirements. 
It is the final testing stage before a system is released to production. The main purpose of acceptance testing is to verify that a system Meets all of its functional and non-functional requirements.
or Example, A user can successfully create an account and log in to the system.

Testing is crucial in software development for several reasons:
-Ensures the software meets specified quality standards and requirements.
-To identifies defects  and issues early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort of fixing them later.-To confirms that the software behaves consistently and reliably under various conditions.
-To detects vulnerabilities and security flaws that could be exploited.
-Help in assessing the software’s performance, including response time, scalability, and resource usage.
-Ensures the software meets user needs and expectations, improving user satisfaction and adoption.
-To verifies that the software complies with regulatory and industry standards.


Question: 12
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Answer:
version control is the process of tracking and managing changes to files over time, and version control software helps automate this process. 
Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools used to manage changes to source code and other project files over time. They keep track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

Importance of Version Control Systems in Software Development include:
-VCS supports code review processes, allowing team members to review each other’s code before it is integrated into the main codebase, which helps maintain code quality.
-VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s changes.
